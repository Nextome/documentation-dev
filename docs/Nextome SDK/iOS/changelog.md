# Nextome SDK - iOS Changelog

The artifactory plugin does not update automatically the Spec Repo info. This means that every time there is a new version it is required to update the index manually

```swift
pod repo-art update nextome-sdk-cocoapods-local
pod install
```


### 2.0.0-rc1.

New version is here! ðŸŽ‰
